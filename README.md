# SPAM MAIL CLASSIFICATION
<h1>
  This Project is about Spam Mail Classification Using Machine Learning Techniques.
</h1>
<p>
The rise of digital communication has led to email becoming an essential medium for both personal and professional interactions. However, the increasing volume of spam emails has become a critical issue. Spam emails are unsolicited, irrelevant, or malicious messages sent in bulk to users inboxes. These emails waste users time, overload email servers and in some cases serve as vectors for phishing attacks, malware, and scams. For organizations, spam emails can lead to data breaches, financial losses, and erosion of customer trust.
To Avoid this the Machine Learning models come into the Picture.
